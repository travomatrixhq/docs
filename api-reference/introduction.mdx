## Welcome

The Nimbus API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for travel agencies to manage authentication, KYC onboarding, wallet transactions, flight searches, and bookings.

## Authentication

All API endpoints (except for Auth and Health) require authentication. We support both Bearer Token (JWT) and Cookie-based authentication.

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <your_token>'
```

## Organized by Domain

The API is organized into logical domains to help you find what you need quickly:

- **Auth**: Manage identity and sessions.
- **Flights**: Search for flights, sectors, and manage bookings.
- **Onboarding**: Track agency KYC progress.
- **Wallet**: Manage balances and view transaction history.
- **Admin**: Internal administrative tasks and audit logs.

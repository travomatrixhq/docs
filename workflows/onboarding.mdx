Before you can book flights, your agency must complete the onboarding and KYC process.

## Checking Status

You can check your current onboarding progress at any time.

```json
GET /api/onboarding/status
```

### Response Example

The response will highlight any missing requirements:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "profile": { "name": "Global Travels" },
    "missing": ["GST_CERTIFICATE", "PAN_CARD"]
  }
}
```

## Completing Requirements

1. **Submit Documents**: Upload the required business documents (GST, PAN, etc.) via the dashboard or specific document endpoints.
2. **Verification**: Our team will review your submission within 24-48 hours.
3. **Activation**: Once verified, your wallet will be enabled for top-ups and bookings.

<Info>
  You can still search for flights while onboarding is in progress, but booking will be disabled until KYC is complete.

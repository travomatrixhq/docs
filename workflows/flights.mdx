Booking a flight with Nimbus is a streamlined three-step process.

## 1. Search for Flights

Use the search endpoint to find available flights based on origin, destination, and dates.

```json
POST /api/flights/search
{
  "origin": "DEL",
  "destination": "BOM",
  "departure_date": "2026-03-15T00:00:00Z",
  "adults": 1,
  "travel_class": "ECONOMY"
}
```

## 2. Review and Select

The search results will return a list of flights with unique IDs. Select the flight that meets your requirements.

<Tip>
  Always verify the `total_price` and `segments` before proceeding to booking, as flight availability changes rapidly.
</Tip>

## 3. Create Booking

Submit the passenger details and the flight information to finalize the booking.

```json
POST /api/flights/booking/create
{
  "flight_id": "fl_123",
  "passengers": [
    {
      "title": "mr",
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "pax_type": "ADULT"
    }
  ],
  "contact": {
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "+919876543210"
  }
}
```

## 4. Confirmation

Upon success, you will receive a `pnr` and a `status` of `CONFIRMED`.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "booking_id": "bk_987",
    "pnr": "ABCDEF",
    "status": "CONFIRMED"
  }
}
```
